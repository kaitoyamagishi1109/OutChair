BUJSA Attendance Software

Copywrite 2019, Kaito Yamagishi, all rights reserved

This is an attendance software which has features corresponding to the google sheets API and the slack API.
Specifically, you can use a USB card swiper in order to fill in their attendance status to a google spreadsheet,
and to notify them via a slack API bot. Although many parts are hardcoded such as the swiper input and the slack API bot settings,
the code itself should be pretty straightfoward, with the help of detailed comments. Once the program is more solidified,
there will be a detailed description on how to get this up and running for your organization.
